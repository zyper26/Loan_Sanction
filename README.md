# Predict the loan sanction Amount

Buying a house requires a lot of careful planning. Once you have finalized your budget and the house that you want to buy, you must ensure that you have sufficient funds to pay the seller.

With rising property rates, most people avail home loans to buy their dream houses. The bank only lends up to 80% of the total amount based on a person's finances (salary, outgoing expenses, existing loans, etc.). You will need to make the rest of the payment yourself after the bank tells you how much they can lend.
